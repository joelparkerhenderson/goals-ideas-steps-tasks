# Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks

Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks (GIST) is a planning system based on the principles of Agile Development and Lean Startups.

* Goals describe the company strategy in terms of desired outcomes. The goals describe where we want to be, by when, and how will we know that we got there.

* Ideas describe hypothetical ways to achieve the goals. Collect all the ideas, then prioritize using evidence, the try as many ideas as possible.

* Steps, a.k.a. Step-Projects, are how to test the ideas. Each idea gets a small short step-project, to gather evidence and decide whether to develop the idea further.

* Tasks are bite-size activities that build each step. Tasks are well covered by agile planning tools, kanban boards and other modern development project management techniques.


GIST can be efficient and effective, and also works well with Objectives and Key Results (OKR), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), agile software development, lean software development, and similar high-performance systems.
